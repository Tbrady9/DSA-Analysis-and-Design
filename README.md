# DSA-Analysis-and-Design

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
This course was all about analyzing different data structures and alogorithms to make an informed decision about implementing a course scheduling system for ABC University. The system needed to read data from a csv file, parse and store it, before manipulating it to return data for a specific course input by the user or printing a list of all courses needed.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
Approaching the problem meant understanding some of the data structures at our disposal and analyzing some of the sorting algorithms. We reviewed things like arrays, vectors, hashing, linked lists and binary search trees. You also need to unserstand what is being asked of the system. Some things to take into consideration are things like the following:
  - Is dynamic resizing of the structure needed?
  - How large is the data sample?
  - What will be the functions of the system (ie... will it mostly be doing searching only or will there be a lot of adding and removing of data

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
The answer to this, unfortunately, is I did not overcome some roadblocks. After reviewing the textbook from this class as well as others and searching online via things like stackoverflow, I was not able to figure out how to add the data for the prerequisites into the struct. This, however, was only one of a few roadblocks that were encountered. Others were solved using the methods above.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
Obviously I learned a lot about things like data structures and alogorithms. Some of the secondary things that I may have learned indirectly through gaining that knowledge is that planning is so critical. I've never really put much thought into things like runtimes and memory usage. I know that there are multiple ways for a program to be written but figured getting done is the important part. This course has taught me that thought and planning needs to be put into how something is done so save on things like time and resource. it's also taught me more about what I already knew when it comes to things like naming convention. When you're dealing with things like variables, vectors and structs, there is a real possiblity of confusing the names of things.
